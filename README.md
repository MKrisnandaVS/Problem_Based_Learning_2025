## 🧠 Project Overview

**SmartClass** is an AI-powered adaptive learning platform designed to support secondary school students by personalizing their learning experience. This project was developed as part of our **Problem-Based Learning (PBL)** initiative, where real-world problems are tackled through innovative, tech-driven solutions.

### 🎯 Project Goals

- Create a personalized learning environment tailored to each student’s learning style.
- Empower teachers to monitor and support student progress more effectively.
- Leverage modern technologies to improve educational quality and accessibility.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Many students struggle to learn effectively because:

- They have different learning styles that are not accommodated.
- Traditional teaching is one-size-fits-all and lacks personalization.
- Teachers are overwhelmed and can't always track individual progress.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Our team developed **SmartClass**, an intelligent platform that:

- Uses AI to assess student learning styles and performance.
- Recommends personalized learning content and exercises.
- Provides teachers with a dashboard to monitor progress and learning gaps.
- Uses Firebase for real-time database and authentication.

🛠️ **Technologies Used:**

- `Python` – for backend and AI logic
- `Scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `matplotlib` – for ML models and data visualization
- `MLflow` – to manage and track experiments
- `Firebase` – for cloud database and user auth
- `Jupyter Notebook` – for exploratory data analysis and prototyping

## 🧪 PBL Workflow

1. **Problem Identification** – Recognizing the lack of personalized education.
2. **Analysis & Brainstorming** – Understanding how tech can fill the gap.
3. **Solution Design** – Planning the system architecture and workflow.
4. **Product Development** – Building and training AI models, integrating backend.
5. **Testing & Evaluation** – Getting feedback from teachers and students.
